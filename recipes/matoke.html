        <li>2 spring onions, chopped</li>            
        <li>3 medium tomatoes, diced</li>            
        <li>4 garlic cloves, minced</li>            
        <li>1 teaspoon tomato paste</li>            
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>            
        <li>4 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>            
        <li>1 glass of water</li>            
        <li>a bunch of fresh coriander for garnishing</li>            
        <li>a piece of bread to go with (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Start by filling a big pot with water enough to cover the plantains and bringing it to a boil. Place the plantains in the boiling water and boil for 10 minutes. Remove from heat and set aside to cool off. Once cooled, peel of the skin and set aside</li>
        <li>    In a saucepan place beef, bone marrow, garlic and the glass of water and boil on medium heat for 20 minutes</li>            
        <li>    Separate meat from broth and set aside (you will need the broth later)</li>            
        <li>    In the same saucepan, heat up oil on medium heat, add onions and fry till soft and translucence. Add beef and fry till it starts to brown. Add tomatoes and tomato paste and cook until the fresh tomatoes have softened.</li>            
        <li>    Add carrots and potatoes and stir the mixture well. Let it simmer on low heat for about 5 minutes stirring in between to avoid it from burning</li>            
        <li>    Add the broth you had set aside earlier and stir in salt to taste. Let it boil for a minute or two. Place Matoke / Plantain (you can leave them whole or cut them in half or as you desire) in the boiling broth, lower the heat to low and simmer the mixture for about 30-45 minutes or until Matoke / Plantain are done. Gently stir in between to avoid it from sticking at the bottom of the pan but also be careful not to break the Matoke / Plantain</li>            
        <li>    Garnish with fresh coriander and serve hot with a piece of bread on the side.</li>
    </ol>
